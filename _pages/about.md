I am an AI Engineer/Consultant currently in the process of transitioning into academic research on AI and Foundation Models. Working with TabbieMe, an EdTech startup, I developed a comprehensive service to evaluate students' answer sheets using foundation models. Before being a self-employed consultant, I spent 8 months working with Flexday AI as a Software Engineer. I graduated from IIT Madras in 2024, where I studied B.Tech and M.Tech in Chemical Engineering (Joint Degree).\\
Research Interests: These days, I spend time thinking about building Personalised AI tutors that operate on an intelligent learning cycle of Adaptive Evaluations and Personalised Remediation.
